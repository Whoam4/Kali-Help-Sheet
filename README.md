## üåê NMAP Commands

Nmap (‚ÄúNetwork Mapper‚Äù) is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It's a versatile tool used by both systems and network administrators for tasks like network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

### Commands

| Command | Description |

| `nmap -v -sS -A -T4 target` | Nmap verbose scan, runs syn stealth, T4 timing, OS and service version info, traceroute and scripts against services. |
| `ping sweep sudo nmap -pn target` | Does a ping sweep over the target's network to see all the available IPs. |
| `nmap -v -sS -p‚ÄìA -T4 target` | As above but scans all TCP ports (takes a lot longer). |
| `nmap -v -sU -sS -p- -A -T4 target` | As above but scans all TCP ports and UDP scan (takes even longer). |
| `nmap -v -p 445 ‚Äìscript=smb-check-vulns --script-args=unsafe=1 192.168.1.X` | Nmap script to scan for vulnerable SMB servers. |
| `nmap localhost` | Displays all the ports that are currently in use. |
| `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/* | grep ftp` | Search nmap scripts for keywords. |
